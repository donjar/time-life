Imagine a life where everyone has a "mental time". People have a much greater sense on how time goes.

I know exactly how fast time runs... I know exactly when is 10 a.m. I know exactly when is one minute from now.

This is not something humans normally possess. Do you still remember how many seconds have passed since you pressed the "start" button?

Not bad. Did you guess, or do you really count how much time has passed?
Nope. It indeed is hard, isn't it? Humans are not meant to have such a high level of concentration.

Anyways, in this alternate universe, all people has this superpower - they know exactly what time it is, and how fast time goes.

Many tools in our universe are rendered obsolete - watches, timers, clocks, stopwatches, hourglasses...

What happens in this universe? Will everything be better? Will everything be worse?

Let us follow the story of John.

It was exactly 23 January 2033, 16:00:00. John just woke up from his bed.

Wait what? He just woke up? Isn't it the evening already?

Not in this world. There is no such thing as "timezones" in this universe - everyone follows the same time governed by the United Kingdom. People realized that changing timezones throws off their mental time and messes up their minds by needing to add/subtract hours every day.

Why United Kingdom, though? It involved a massive war that killed millions of people. After that dark era, all parents decided to teach their children to synchronize with UK time.

Interesting, isn't it? People do everything to not give up their mental time.

Anyways, let's go back to the story of John. He picked up his phone and he saw a message. What he saw made him jump out of his bed.

"There's a car accident near King Hotel. Traffic jam for like 5 kilometers. Come ASAP!"

"Impossible!" John shouted. He quickly ran to the shower.

"It's 16:02:12 already. It will take me at least 7 minutes 22 seconds to dress up and go, and by then, I only have 50 minutes 26 seconds left to reach the church..."

"I hope the traffic jam is not very bad... Why am I ruining my brother's big day!!"

Indeed, today is Hugo's big day - it's his marriage.

As soon as the shower is turned on, he jumped into it. Freezing cold water striked through his skin. By the time the water heater turns on, he had already rinsed off soap from his body.

Once he's done, he went to the sink to brush his teeth. Just mere 13 seconds after, with a bit of white toothpaste around his mouth, he ran to his closet.

With a part of his shirt untucked, he jumped into his car. It was 16:09:37. He still need to wait until the engine starts.

"47 seconds... 46 seconds... 45 seconds... Argh, can time go faster? These 47 seconds seem like hell!"

Sweat ran down his cheeks, even though he had the air conditioner on. At exactly 16:10:24, he stormed out of his garage, driving at a speed as fast as a Ferrari.

"I have 49 minutes 36 seconds... I hope I reach in time..."

Since he drove to city almost every day in 10 years for work, he knew by experience about how much time he takes to drive from his home to his office. The wedding is located not far from his office.

Normally it would take around 40 minutes 23 seconds to reach the office. With a traffic jam though, it might take at least 10 minutes more. He'll be late by more than 30 seconds!

"Oh no! Better message Hugo... Hope that he's not angry..."

On the other side, Hugo is preparing things with his fianc√©e. He is anxious, not because John would come late, but because of something else...

"Uh oh, I hope John is OK... He needs to know that we're in no hurry..."

A new message entered Hugo's phone.

"I'm going there quickly. Very sorry, but I might be late for 3 seconds!"

Hugo quickly replied the message. "It's OK Josh, you can even be late for 30 minutes..."

It is 16:41:11. The exact moment Josh's car slowed down to a halt. So many cars are around him, waiting for the jam to clear.

"No way I'll reach there on time! This is a disaster!"

"This is the first time my schedule is wrecked this badly! Why am I only putting a 10 minute buffer time... I could have put a much longer buffer time, stupid me!"

He waited in the traffic jam. 1 second... 2 seconds... Even though Josh knows exactly how fast time goes, time still passes pretty slowly. It's as if time teased him.

He moved his legs furiously, his seat going up and down as Josh very impatiently waited. His brain feels occupied with his anxiety. Occasionally he sounded the horn, even though he knew it won't make any use.

It seemed like hell for him. For most people in the universe, getting stuck and doing nothing is not something that most people can bear.

Having "mental time" allows people to organize schedule to the point of seconds. As such, most people are not able to stand wasting time, even mere seconds.

As soon as the car in front moves, John pressed the gas so hard. BOOM...
